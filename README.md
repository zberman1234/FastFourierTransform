# Fast Fourier Transform in Java
This file contains an implementation of the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (FFT) algorithm. The FFT is an efficient algorithm for calculating the Fourier Transform of a sequence. It can be used to analyze the frequency content of a signal and has applications in a variety of fields, including signal and image processing and telecommunications.

### Usage
To use the FFT implementation, you can pass in an array of Complex objects as an argument to the fft method. The Complex class is a custom class included in this file that represents complex numbers with real and imaginary components.

The fft method will return an array of Complex objects that represents the Fourier transform of the input array.

### Testing
This file also includes some test cases to ensure that the fft method is working correctly. The test cases are run in the main method, and confirm that the FFT method returns the expected results of the Fourier Transform.
